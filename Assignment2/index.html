                First, a few handy bits of informationâ€”otherwise known as the basics of choosing and storing oranges, which ensures that you always have this favorite citrus in tip-top condition to snack on or when you want to make any of the recipes here. When are oranges in season? They're at their peak between December and April, and that's when we most enjoy them. Since oranges keep well in cold storage, they can be found in supermarkets throughout the year.

            <p class="section-title" id="sec-ti2">tomato</p>
            <p class="section">
                Place tomatoes cored-side down on a cutting board. Make 8 cuts down each tomato, slicing almost to the bottom (or core) but not all the way through. Carefully transfer the tomatoes to a serving platter. Fill each cut alternately with mozzarella and basil. Sprinkle with salt and pepper. Drizzle with oil and balsamic glaze.

                Blanch green beans in a large pot of salted water until tender, 5 minutes. Drain and transfer to a large plate or rimmed baking sheet to cool.
                <br><br>
                Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high. Add garlic and cook until softened and just beginning to color, 1 to 2 minutes. Add green beans and season generously with salt and pepper. When green beans are hot, toss in lemon slices and cook 1 minute over high. Check seasoning -- beans should be well-seasoned and bright but not too sour. Serve hot, or preferably at room temperature.
